# Computing Coursework - Imperial ME2
2D dye concentration solver given a fluid velocity profile using an FVM discretisation approach.

Written by Jed Nelson and Sophie Morris.

## Requirements
Required libraries are:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- *pygame*

## Running
Run `main.py`, make sure to comment/uncomment the desired plot in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section.
I would reccomend commenting out the pygame bits if you want to run any other plot as it is quite resource intensive.

## Reading the Report
The report is `Report.pdf`.  Apologies if the handwritten derivation is slightly hard to follow, but it will be so much better than anything done with Word equations.
